# 🌐 Google Homepage Redesign — Installable Theme  
A modern, minimal redesign of the Google homepage created as part of my UI/UX learning journey as a full-stack developer.

This project lets you **use the redesigned Google page as an installable web app (PWA)** on both Windows and macOS — so it feels like a native Google app with its own icon.

If you like this project, please **⭐ Star this repository** — it means a lot and motivates future updates!
